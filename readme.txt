Soundscape 2.0!

Using phone(s) as a sonar to image a room or object in x dimensions (like Batman).

Notes - long term plan:
1) Chirp frequency generation - Check!
2) Receive the signal
2) Cross-correlation
3) Plot data - Well under way
4) Profit

Requirements:
1) Set up a local phone database to store data, or a server to handle everything.
2) Error corrections to improve signal to noise ratio
3) Image processing..


Ricard: 
1) Not succeded to make a cross correlation that works. The numbers doesnt fit with the matlab inbuilt function 







Original Idea //--------------------------------------------------------------------
Soundscape!
Using an audio signal to transfer data between multiple clients. 
Nevermind, AudioNetwork did that.

Notes:
HTML/CSS and JS for sending and receiving the signal.
Run clients on localhost, potentially on phone.

To do:
Figure out how to send signal
